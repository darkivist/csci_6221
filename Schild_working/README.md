**Contains working to-do app files for sharing**

**Xcode automatically generates these files but with basic/shell code. Update them with the code in the like-files found in this folder.**
  - AppDelegate.swift
  - SceneDelegate.swift
  - ViewController.swift
  - Main.storyboard

  
**These two need to be created by the user:**
  - TaskViewController.swift
  - EntryViewController.swift


**Tips if new to Xcode:**
  - The simulator might need to be cleared out and reset sometimes. Do so by running the below in the terminal
      1: xcrun simctl erase all
      2: rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
